ANALYTICAL COOKING - Part I

Cooking and data-analytics are very different, this is true - opposites in fact. They could be used as examples to represent the left and right brain. But many things are true at the same time, and in this case, there is another accurate statement - cooking and data analytics are one in the same.

It is the outward manifestation of these two processes that are so very different - the tools, the components, the skills, the arena in which they are performed in ... all completely different. But when you look passed that, and straight at the thought process underneath, its shockingly similar.

It’s the ability to take a ton of information, home in on what’s important and present it in the most palatable way. In the case of food, a chef needs to understand just that - the palate. THAT is her audience...that is the stakeholder she needs to appeal to. So he takes his ingredients, washes them and realizes how fresh n' rare the tomatoes are. In that moment she decides to make a sauce that highlights the natural flavor. She teases out the information in those tomatoes by introducing them to heat and salt. He uses garlic and onion to support the tangy sweetness. The smells, and the sounds of the pan...it’s a stream of information, so much information.

Similarly, when you look at a dataset, you point your attention towards what is most important. You ask the right questions and home in on what will tease out the answers... what will best enable you to tell a meaningful story. One variable helps to bring out another. This is like using something sweet to help showcase something sour. Of course, Excel and Python are very different from say...sautéing and blanching, but in the end both data-analysts and chefs everywhere are doing their best to tell a story. They are working hard to pull everything they can out of their respective ingredients, and it’s a beautiful process.
